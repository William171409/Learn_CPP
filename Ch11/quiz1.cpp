// Pretend youâ€™re writing a game where the player can hold 3 types of items:
// health potions, torches, and arrows. Create an enum to identify the different
// types of items, and an std::array to store the number of each item the player
// is carrying (the enumerators are used as indexes of the array).
// The player should start with 2 health potions, 5 torches, and 10 arrows.
// Write a function called countTotalItems() that returns how many items the player
// has in total. Have your main() function print the output of countTotalItems()
// as well as the number of torches.

#include <iostream>
#include <array>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iterator>
#include <numeric> // std::reduce
