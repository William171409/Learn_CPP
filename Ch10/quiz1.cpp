/*Question #1

In designing a game, we decide we want to have monsters, because everyone likes fighting
monsters. Declare a struct that represents your monster. The monster should have a type that
can be one of the following: an ogre, a dragon, an orc, a giant spider, or a slime.
Use an enum class for this.Each individual monster should also have a name
(use a std::string or std::string_view), as well as an amount of health that represents
how much damage they can take before they die.
Write a function named printMonster() that prints out all of the structâ€™s members.
Instantiate an ogre and a slime, initialize them using an initializer list,
and pass them to printMonster().*/
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <string_view> 
// Notice that to use std::string_view, the compiler must be in the version after C++17

    dragon,
